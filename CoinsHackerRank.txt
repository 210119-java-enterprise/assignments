n is the amount to get change for
m is the list of values we get
m is sorted bigest to smallest

* make a set of lists that holds the acceptable 
ways to give change

to find a solution: 
get the bigest value that can 
fit in n (however many time you can) 

then find another value from m that can fit 
(however many times)  every time you add a value
add it to a temporary list

keep doing the above step until the n = 0 then check
if the temporary list already exists in set of lists

if it doesnt add it to the list
if it does then remove the last element in the list and
 add it to n.  check again if there is a value in m that
can go into n (as many times as it can)
