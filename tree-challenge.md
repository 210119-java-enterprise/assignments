# Challenge

Implement a custom binary-tree structure (no specific-implementation, so feel free to chose whichever you'd like to implement) with the following functionalities:
- `void insert(T data)`
- `boolean contains(T data)`
- `sremove(T data)`  (removes the first occurrence)
- `int size()` (gives the number of nodes stored in the tree)
