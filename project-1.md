# Project 1 - Custom Object Relational Mapping Framework

## Description

Your first project will be to create a custom object relational mapping (ORM) framework. This framework will allow for a simplified and SQL-free interaction with the relational data source. Some suggested features that your ORM can provide are:

1. A public API that can be added as a dependency in other projects

2. File-based or programmatic configuration of entities

3. Programmatic persistence of entities (basic CRUD support)

4. Basic transaction management (begin, commit, savepoint, rollback)

5. Connection pooling

6. Lightweight session creation

7. Session-based caching to minimize calls to the database
